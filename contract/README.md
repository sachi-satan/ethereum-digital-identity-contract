# Digital Identity Project

This project demonstrates the use of a Digital Identity smart contract. It includes the contract itself, tests for the contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys the contract.

## Getting Started

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/DigitalIdentity.ts --network localhost
```
